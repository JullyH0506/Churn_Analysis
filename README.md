# Churn_Analysis

This project aims to perform a basic customer churn analysis of a telco company and predict the future behaviour of clients. The obtained results can be used to develop focused customer retention programs.

I performed some Exploratory Data Analysis as well as compared various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive and Gradient Boosting. To improve the score of models over-sampling and hyperparameter tunning were used.

In the result Random Forest Classifier gived the most accurate predictions, having a **91% f1-score**. 

The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
